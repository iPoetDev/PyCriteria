# [Tutoring Guidelines](https://code-institute-org.github.io/tutoring-info/guidelines/ "")

## Benefits of Tutoring

1. A tutoring session is an active learning experience in which you will not only fix your code.

- AND learn new career skills while doing so.

2. Students who engage in tutoring progress more quickly through the course than those who don't, and are more likely to
   succeed.
3. Tutors can help you to
   i. Understand course concepts that you're unclear on,
   ii. Interpret documentation and error messages, and
   iii. develop troubleshooting skills that will prove invaluable in the industry.
4. Tutors will teach you how to resolve your issues, rather than fixing them for you.

- Please do not enter a tutoring session with the expectation of an easy fix -
- Expect the learning process can be long and difficult, but will be worth it in the end.

5. With that in mind, tutors will frequently ask students to carry out various tasks.

- Students are expected to actively participate in these tasks as they constitute the majority of the learning
  experience (i.e. learn by doing).
- The active collaboration required in tutoring sessions means that tutoring will only be delivered through online IDEs,
  not local IDEs.

## Best Practice

- **Patience**
    - Troubleshooting is a process. It is sometimes a very long process. It is always a very repetitive process.
        - In the software world, it can take days to track down and fix a single bug.
        - You're unlikely to encounter anything quite so complex here, but on occasion, tutoring sessions can take
          longer than you'd expect or involve a considerable amount of drudgery.
        - This is a core part of programming, and cannot be avoided.
- **Usage**
    - The average student uses about 30 minutes of tutoring per week.
    - Your access to tutoring will be capped at 90 minutes per week, in order to ensure fair access to all students.
    - If you reach the cap in any given week, you will be assigned steps to help you continue with your work
    - Will relying less on tutoring.
